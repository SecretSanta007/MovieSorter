# MovieSorter
Give it a directory path where all your movies/documentaries resides. It will fetch the information for each file from IMDB and will write in an Excel spreadsheet. This is helpful when you want to sort all your movies/documentaries by their IMDB ratings, genre, release year, runtime, director, actor, etc.
