# MovieSorter
Give it a directory path where all your movies/documentaries resides. It will fetch the information for each file from IMDB and will write in an Excel spreadsheet. This is helpful when you want to sort all your movies/documentaries by their IMDB ratings, genre, release year, runtime, director, actor, etc.

## Pre-requisites
* ASP.NET Framework Version=v4.5
* MS Excel

If you are interested in just running it without loading the source code in Visual Studio, do the following:

* Clone the respository.
* Browse to "\VideoSorter\VideoSorter\bin\Debug"
* Make sure VideoSorter.exe is there
* now, open command prompt (Window+R)
* CD \<absolute path to the Debug directory mentioned in second point above\>
* Hit Enter key
* type **VideoSorter\<space>\"\<absolute path to the video directory\>"**
* Hit Enter key. If everything is ok, you should start seeing the infomration of the files being processed.
* That's it!
